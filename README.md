# Speech Lab Project

The Speech Lab project is a powerful voice synthesis application that allows users to generate speech from text, add new voices, and clone voices using advanced voice cloning techniques. The application leverages cutting-edge voice synthesis APIs, including the Resemble.ai API, to create realistic and customizable synthetic voices.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- A text editor such as Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Sublime.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo to your local machine using the following command:

    ```
    git clone <repo-link>
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```
    cd speech-lab
    ```

3. Install the necessary npm packages:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:

    ```
    npm start
    ```

    or if you have nodemon installed:

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

The application will now be running on your localhost, typically on port 3000.

## Features
